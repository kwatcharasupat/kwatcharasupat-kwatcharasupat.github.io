title: Digital Signal Processing for Music Analysis and Synthesis
course_code: MUSI 6202
description: Research in music, as well as music production and composition increasingly relies on sophisticated digital signal processing techniques. This course will review fundamental elements of digital audio signal processing, such as sinusoids, spectra, digital filters, and Fourier analysis and their application to music processing problems. We will discuss audio effects and techniques such as fast convolution, phase vocoder, reverb, chorus / flanger, pitch-shifting, time compression, etc. The class will include practical in-class exercises and assignments on frequently used music processing algorithms.
semester: Spring 2023
