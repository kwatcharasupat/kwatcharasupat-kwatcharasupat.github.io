## Full Bio

Karn Watcharasupat (she/her) is a PhD student in Music Technology at the Music Informatics Group, Georgia Institute of Technology, with a secondary MS pursuit in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Her research interests are broadly in machine learning and signal processing for audio and music applications, currently focusing on audio source separation. In 2023, Karn received the AAUW International Doctoral Degree Fellowship by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), and the IEEE Signal Processing Society Scholarship. 

Karn graduated top of her class in 2021, with a B.Eng. (Hons.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. She was the recipient of the Lee Kuan Yew Gold Medal and the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore Gold Medal, and a recipient of the Nanyang Scholarship (CN Yang Scholars Programme).

She has worked with Netflix's Audio Algorithms team in 2023 and 2024. Prior to her doctoral studies, she has worked in NTU Digital Signal Processing and Smart Nation Translational Labs (2020-2022), Aevice Health (2020), and NTU Media Technology Lab (2018-2021), in addition to a visiting collaboration with the Music Informatics Group (2020-2022).

Karn has co-authored a granted patent on distributed array source separation, a patent application on soundscape augmentation, and more than 20 peer-reviewed publications in venues including as the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), IEEE Signal Processing Letters, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (TASLP), IEEE Open Journal on Signal Processing, and IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing. Her work has utilized signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning across tasks such as audio source separation, music information retrieval, sound event localization and detection, speech enhancement, representation learning, and audio content analysis.
